compile OCaml code in parallel; despite ocamlbuild being only sequential ...
Yes, ocamlbuild's -j option is a joke; you didn't know that already?

If you want parallel build for OCaml code right now, just use
a sound build system like obuild: https://github.com/ocaml-obuild/obuild.

Or, wait for this hack to be completed.
